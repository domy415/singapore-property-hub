With only **4,340 private homes** changing hands in Q2 2025 (down 40% from 7,261 in Q1), the dynamics have clearly shifted.\n\nIn this comprehensive analysis based on official URA and HDB data, we'll examine:\n- **Regional performance disparities** with CCR surprising at 2.3% growth\n- **Record million-dollar HDB transactions** despite slower price growth\n- **Strategic opportunities** in a supply-constrained environment\n\n---\n\n## Q2 2025 Performance: Understanding the Moderation\n\n### **Private Property Market Statistics**\n\n| Metric | Q2 2025 | Q1 2025 | Q4 2024 | QoQ Change |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|------------|\n| **Overall Price Growth** | **+0.5%** | +0.8% | +2.3% | -37.5% |\n| **Transaction Volume** | **4,340** | 7,261 | N/A | **-40.2%** |\n| **New Sales** | **1,129** | 3,375 | 3,420 | **-66.5%** |\n| **Resale Transactions** | **3,138** | 3,886 | 4,013 | **-19.2%** |\n| **CCR Growth** | **+2.3%** | +0.8% | N/A | +187.5% |\n| **RCR Growth** | **-1.1%** | +1.7% | N/A | -164.7% |\n| **OCR Growth** | **+0.9%** | +0.3% | N/A | +200% |\n\n### **Regional Analysis**\n\n**Core Central Region (CCR)** - Luxury segment leads with **2.3% QoQ growth**:\n- Limited new supply creating scarcity premium\n- Foreign interest persists despite **60% ABSD**\n- Quality assets outperforming broader market\n\n**Rest of Central Region (RCR)** - Only region declining at **-1.1% QoQ**:\n- Recent launch oversupply weighing on prices\n- Buyers finding better value in OCR\n- Price corrections creating opportunities\n\n**Outside Central Region (OCR)** - Mass market resilient at **0.9% growth**:\n- No new launches in Q2 supporting prices\n- Steady upgrader demand from HDB\n- Best value proposition currently\n\n> ðŸ’° **Market Insight:** OCR offers best risk-reward with limited upcoming supply and consistent demand\n\n---\n\n## HDB Resale Market: Million-Dollar Milestone\n\n### **Q2 2025 HDB Market Overview**\n\n**HDB resale prices rose 0.9% QoQ** -

lowest in 2+ years\n2. **Limited new supply** - only 1,000-1,500 units in Q4\n3. **Negotiation leverage** - especially in RCR segment\n\nThe market has shifted from FOMO-driven buying to calculated decision-making. Success now depends on thorough research, patience, and strategic negotiation rather than rushing into purchases.\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ’¼ **Get Expert Market Guidance**\n\n**Navigate the changing market with personalized analysis based on 50,000+ transaction data points.**\n\n**[BOOK FREE CONSULTATION]**\n\n**What You'll Receive:**\nâœ… **Unsold inventory report** from your target districts\nâœ… **Mortgage optimization** saving $30,000+ over loan tenure\nâœ… **Negotiation strategies** based on current market dynamics\nâœ… **Exclusive access** to pre-market opportunities\n\n*Limited to 20 consultations per month*\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ“Š **Download Q2 2025 Market Report**\n\n**Get the complete 47-page analysis with district-by-district breakdown**\n\n**[DOWNLOAD REPORT]**\n\nIncludes:\n- Transaction analysis by district\n- Price trend projections\n- Investment hotspot identification\n- Policy impact assessment\n\n---\n\n## Sources & References\n\n**Official Data Sources:**\n- Urban Redevelopment Authority - Q2 2025 Flash Estimates, Released July 1, 2025\n- Housing Development Board - Q2 2025 Resale Price Index, Released July 1, 2025\n- Monetary Authority of Singapore - SORA Rates, March 2025 Publication\n- Ministry of Trade and Industry - GDP Forecast, Revised April 2025\n\n**Market Analysis:**\n- CBRE Singapore - Q2 2025 Residential Market Commentary\n- PropNex Realty - Q2 2025 Market Report\n- ERA Singapore - Quarterly Analysis Q2 2025\n- 99.co - Market Insights Report Q2 2025\n- EdgeProp - Transaction Analysis Q2 2025\n\n**Policy Documents:**\n- MAS - Property Loan Measures, August 2024\n- MND - Cooling Measures Framework, Updated 2024\n- IRAS - Stamp Duty Rates, Current as of 2025\n\n---\n\n**About This Analysis:** \nThis report compiles publicly available data from URA, HDB, and market reports.
