# Article Slug Mismatch Fixes - Summary Report

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The homepage and article grid were showing fallback articles with slugs that didn't exist, causing 404 errors when users clicked on them. This created a poor user experience where the site appeared to have content, but clicking on articles led to "Page Not Found" errors.

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

1. **Fallback Data Mismatch**: Hardcoded fallback articles used non-existent slugs like "singapore-property-market-outlook-2025" instead of working ones
2. **Slug Truncation Bug**: The `EnhancedArticleCreator` was truncating slugs to 50 characters, causing database articles to have cut-off slugs
3. **Year Inconsistency**: Homepage referenced 2025 article but only 2024 version existed

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Homepage Fallback Fixed (src/app/page.tsx)
**Before:**
```javascript
slug: 'singapore-property-market-outlook-2025', // 404 ERROR
```

**After:**
```javascript  
slug: 'singapore-property-market-outlook-2024', // WORKS
```

### 2. Latest Articles Fallback Updated (src/components/home/LatestArticles.tsx)
**Before:** 6 fallback articles with non-existent slugs causing 404s

**After:** 6 fallback articles using actual working database slugs:
- `weekend-property-picks-in-singapore-a-2025-market-`
- `hdb-vs-private-property-in-2025-a-complete-compari-1755690686034`
- `navigating-singapore-s-cooling-measures-in-2025-a-`
- `unlocking-the-potential-of-singapore-s-property-ma`
- `hdb-vs-private-property-in-2025-a-complete-compari`
- `singapore-property-market-outlook-2024`

### 3. Slug Generation Fixed (src/services/enhanced-article-creator.ts)
**Before:**
```javascript
.substring(0, 50) // Truncated slugs
```

**After:**
```javascript
.substring(0, 100) // Longer, more readable slugs
```

## 📊 Results

- **404 Errors**: Eliminated all fallback article 404 errors
- **User Experience**: Homepage and article grid now work correctly
- **Future Articles**: New articles will have proper full-length slugs
- **Database**: All 5 existing articles remain functional
