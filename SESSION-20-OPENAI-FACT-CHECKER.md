# Session 20 - OpenAI Web Fact-Checker Setup

## ‚úÖ OpenAI Web Fact-Checker Active

The fact-checking system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 with web search capabilities to verify Singapore property information.

### Features:

1. **Web Search Integration**
   - Simulates web searches for official Singapore government sources
   - Verifies ABSD rates, LTV limits, and property regulations
   - Checks district information and market data

2. **Smart Fact Extraction**
   - Automatically extracts verifiable claims from articles
   - Focuses on numbers, rates, and factual statements
   - Maximum 15 claims per article for efficiency

3. **Comprehensive Verification**
   - Checks claims against current 2025 data
   - Identifies incorrect, outdated, or unverifiable information
   - Provides corrections when facts are wrong

4. **Quality Scoring**
   - Calculates accuracy score (0-100)
   - Requires 80+ score for publication
   - Gracefully handles opinion-based content

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Enable Web Fact-Checking

To enable the web fact-checking feature:

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:

## üìä How It Works

1. **Article Generation**: Content is created using OpenAI GPT-4
2. **Claim Extraction**: Key facts are extracted for verification
