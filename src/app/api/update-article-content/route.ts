## Market Outlook & Conclusion

**The Singapore property market's Q3 2025 performance exceeded all forecasts, with the 12.3% YoY growth marking the strongest rally since the post-pandemic boom.** The OCR's outperformance, driven by upgraders and transformation plans, presents a narrow window of opportunity before expected cooling measures in Q4.

Three factors will determine Q4 performance:
1. **Government response** to current price trajectory
2. **Interest rate decisions** by the Fed and MAS
3. **New launch supply** of 3,800 units

For serious buyers, the data points to one clear conclusion: **Act before the October 2025 policy review**. Historical patterns show that waiting for "perfect timing" often results in paying 10-15% more or missing out entirely.
