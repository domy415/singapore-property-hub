# Project Property - Singapore Real Estate Lead Generation Platform

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive Singapore property website focused on residential (condominiums, landed properties) and commercial shophouses. The platform will feature:
- SEO-optimized content for high Google rankings
- Automated daily content creation and posting
- LinkedIn integration for social media presence
- Property listing scraper from PropertyGuru and 99.co
- Automated lead response and notification system

## 🤖 AI Agent Architecture (Updated 2025-08-28)
The platform utilizes a sophisticated multi-agent system for content generation and optimization:

### Agent Workflow for Article Generation:
1. **property-article-writer** - Primary content generation agent
   - Writes SEO-optimized articles based on scheduled topics
   - Follows all article requirements (2000-2500 words, fact-checked, current market data)
   - Integrates with content calendar for topic selection

2. **singapore-property-scorer** (for condo reviews only)
   - Provides comprehensive property scoring (1-5 stars)
   - Analyzes location, developer, design, and investment potential
   - Generates strengths, concerns, and investment recommendations
   - Output integrated into condo review articles

3. **singapore-property-report-generator** (for all articles)
   - Creates professional one-page property reports
   - **HTML format**: For email newsletter attachments
   - **PDF format**: For user downloads
   - Extracts key insights from articles and property scores
   - Visually appealing design with charts and ratings

## 🏢 CONDO REVIEW WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

### Proper Agent Sequence:
1. **singapore-property-scorer** → generates DQI scores (0-100)
2. **singapore-property-report-generator** → uses DQI scores for report
3. **Condo review page** → displays DQI-based rating (DQI/20 = stars)

### CRITICAL: All ratings MUST come from DQI scoring, never arbitrary values

4. **linkedin-property-content-optimizer** (for all articles)
   - Optimizes content for LinkedIn engagement
   - Creates compelling post headlines and snippets
   - Suggests hashtags and engagement strategies
   - Maximizes visibility and user interaction

### Agent Integration Requirements:
- All agents work in sequence for each scheduled article
- Condo reviews require property scoring before article generation
- Reports generated after article completion
- LinkedIn optimization applied before social media posting
- Error handling with fallback to standard generation if any agent fails

## 📝 Article Generation Workflow (Multi-Agent System)

### Daily Automated Process (9 AM SGT):
1. **Topic Selection**
   - Content calendar checks for scheduled topics
   - Identifies if topic is condo review or general content
   - Applies 7-day anti-repetition logic

2. **Content Generation Pipeline**:
   
   **For Condo Reviews:**
   - singapore-property-scorer → property-article-writer → fact-checker → report-generator → linkedin-optimizer
   
   **For General Articles:**
   - property-article-writer → fact-checker → report-generator → linkedin-optimizer

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Fact-checking with 80+ quality score requirement
   - Singapore-specific validation (ABSD, LTV, districts)
   - Automatic revision if errors detected

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Main article (2000-2500 words) saved to database
   - HTML report generated for email newsletter
   - PDF report generated for downloads
   - LinkedIn post optimized and scheduled

5. **Distribution**:
   - Article published on website
   - Email newsletter with HTML report attachment
   - LinkedIn post with optimized content
   - PDF available for user download

### Manual Article Generation:
- Same workflow available via admin interface
- Test endpoints for individual agent testing
- Override options for topic selection

1. **property-article-writer**: 
   - ✅ **WHEN Writing Condo Reviews** → MUST use verified developer images from `CONDO_DEVELOPER_IMAGES`
   - ❌ **WHEN Writing Market Analysis** → Charts/graphs/generic images allowed
   - ❌ **WHEN Writing Policy Articles** → Normal image selection process

2. **singapore-property-report-generator**:

## Session 14 Summary (2025-08-27)  
This session focused on advanced AI integration and deployment stability.
