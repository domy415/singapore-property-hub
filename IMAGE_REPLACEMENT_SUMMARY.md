- ✅ **Free license prioritization** (reduces attribution complexity)
- ✅ **Professional quality guaranteed** (no watermarks, good composition)

district: '9', neighborhood: 'Orchard Road' → luxury shopping district image
```

// Example: Investment article gets Singapore CBD imagery
conceptType: 'finance' → Singapore financial district representation
