## Market Enters Sustainable Phase After Strong 2024

**Singapore's private residential property market has decisively shifted to a more sustainable pace, with Q2 2025 prices rising just 0.5% quarter-on-quarter** - marking the third consecutive quarter of moderating growth, according to URA's flash estimates.

The deceleration from Q1 2025's **0.8% growth** and Q4 2024's **2.3% surge** reflects a market adjusting to limited new supply and cautious buyer sentiment. With only **4,340 private homes** changing hands in Q2 2025 (down 40% from 7,261 in Q1), the dynamics have clearly shifted.

In this comprehensive analysis based on official URA and HDB data, we'll examine:
- **Regional performance disparities** with CCR surprising at 2.3% growth
- **Record million-dollar HDB transactions** despite slower price growth
- **Strategic opportunities** in a supply-constrained environment

## The Bottom Line

**Singapore's property market has entered a healthy consolidation phase, with Q2 2025's 0.5% growth signaling sustainable momentum rather than speculation.** The 40% drop in transaction volumes and 66.5% decline in new sales create a buyer's market for those with ready finances.

Three key factors define the current opportunity:
1. **Mortgage rates at 2.5-2.75%** - lowest in 2+ years
2. **Limited new supply** - only 1,000-1,500 units in Q4
3. **Negotiation leverage** - especially in RCR segment

The market has shifted from FOMO-driven buying to calculated decision-making. Success now depends on thorough research, patience, and strategic negotiation rather than rushing into purchases.
